## What This Shows

CreatorPulse is an AI-powered SaaS platform that turns a single text prompt into a fully produced, published YouTube video. This is a frontend prototype demonstrating the 8-step pipeline flow:

1. **Script** — AI-generated voiceover script with hook, sections, and CTA
2. **SEO & Meta** — Title variants, description, and tags optimized for your audience
3. **Voiceover** — ElevenLabs neural voice selection with emotion control
4. **Visuals** — Stock footage and AI images matched to script segments
5. **Thumbnails** — Two A/B variants designed for click-through rate
6. **Assembly** — FFmpeg render combining video, audio, subtitles, and music
7. **Review** — Preview the final video with a full publish summary
8. **Publish** — Upload to YouTube with metadata and A/B thumbnail testing

Each step includes an approval gate so the creator stays in control of the output.

## Why CreatorPulse?

### The Problem

Running a faceless YouTube channel today means juggling 5–8 separate tools: ChatGPT for scripts, ElevenLabs for voiceover, Pexels for footage, Canva for thumbnails, CapCut for editing, TubeBuddy for SEO. Each tool has its own subscription, its own learning curve, and its own export-import dance. A single 8-minute video takes 4–6 hours of manual work across all of them.

### The Solution

CreatorPulse replaces the entire toolchain with one subscription. You type a prompt, approve each step, and get a published video on your channel. No API keys to manage, no accounts to juggle, no files to shuttle between apps. We handle all the AI services behind the scenes — you just focus on your content ideas.

### What Sets Us Apart

**You stay in control.** Unlike fully automated generators that spit out cookie-cutter content, CreatorPulse gives you an approval gate at every step. Edit the script, swap a voice, change a visual — then move forward. It's AI-assisted, not AI-replaced.

**Built for long-form.** Most competitors focus on 60-second Shorts. CreatorPulse is designed for the 8–15 minute faceless videos that actually build audiences and qualify for full ad monetization.

**Audience intelligence built in.** Connect your YouTube channel and CreatorPulse scans your analytics — demographics, watch patterns, peak hours, top-performing topics — to tailor every script and thumbnail to *your* audience, not a generic template.

**A/B testing from day one.** Every video ships with two thumbnail variants. YouTube's Test & Compare feature picks the winner automatically. Over time, the system learns what visual styles drive clicks for your specific niche.

**Self-improving feedback loop.** After publishing, CreatorPulse tracks performance for 7 days and feeds the results back into future generations. Your 10th video is smarter than your 1st.

### How It Works for the Customer

1. **Subscribe** — pick a plan (Starter, Creator, Pro, or Agency)
